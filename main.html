	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a software developer because I love solving real-world problems using technology. 
      Creating applications that make people’s lives easier gives me a sense of purpose and satisfaction. 
      I’m also fascinated by how quickly the tech industry evolves, which means there’s always something 
      new to learn and improve upon. Becoming a developer allows me to combine creativity with logic and 
      continuously grow in a field that impacts the future.</p>
